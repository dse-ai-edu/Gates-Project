  "Correctness-Focused": {
    "introduction": "Definition:
The most basic level of feedback content centers on the accuracy of a response, often termed verification or knowledge of results (KR).

## Core Concepts

- **Verification**: This is a simple dichotomous judgment that indicates whether an answer is correct or incorrect.
- **Knowledge of Correct Response (KCR)**: This identifies the correct answer, allowing the student to see the target result.
- **Error Flagging**: This highlights the location of an error without necessarily providing the correct answer, prompting the student to find the mistake themselves.
- **Task-Level Feedback (FT)**: This focuses on how well a task is being performed, distinguishing correct from incorrect answers and building surface knowledge. It is the most common form of feedback used in classrooms.
- **Descriptive Feedback**: Focuses on the substance of the work, providing clear evidence of behavior and detailing the \"what, how, and why\" of a performance.
- **Corrective Suggestions**: These are action-oriented moves in which instructors provide specific directives in the margins or at the end of the work to help students improve in the future.

    "introduction": "Definition:
More sophisticated feedback focuses on procedural knowledge, which provides information on the actions and strategies needed to complete a task.

## Core Concepts

- **Procedural Feedback**: This addresses the specific arithmetic operations, rules, or algorithms a student must follow.
- **\"Bug-Related\" Feedback**: This relies on \"bug libraries\" to identify and correct specific procedural errors or common mistakes students make during the process.
- **Strategy Information**: This provides hints or cues about successful cognitive strategies, helping the student know how to proceed when they encounter an obstacle.

Panadero and Lipnevich emphasize that feedback is most effective when it shifts from outcomes to the underlying processes and reasoning involved in learning.

- **Conceptual Feedback**: This focuses on the theories and definitions underlying a task.

Example Response:

Strengths
The expression for \( \sec \theta \) has been correctly determined as \( \sec \theta = \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \), following the proper application of the cosine and secant identities. Additionally, the process of transitioning from \( \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{2\sqrt{x^2+1}}{x^2} \right) = \phi \) to expressing \( \cot \phi \) has been articulated appropriately.

Weaknesses
The equation \( \tan^{-1} x = 0 \) produces a value of \( x = 0 \), but further analysis of this equation is necessary to provide context for the remaining calculations. The subsequent steps show a lack of clarity in connecting each transformation throughout the problem. Specifically, the derivation for \( \sin \phi \) appears inconsistent, as it should reflect the relationship derived from \( \cot \phi \) rather than an arbitrary substitution involving \( x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \). This results in a misalignment with conventional trigonometric identities.

Suggestions for improvement
The basic trigonometric identities should be reviewed to ensure clarity in transformations throughout the work. Specifically, the conversion from \( \cot \phi \) to \( \sin \phi \) requires adherence to the definitions of these functions. It is recommended to derive \( \sin \phi \) directly from the expression of \( \cot \phi = \frac{\cos \phi}{\sin \phi} \) and \( \sin^2 \phi + \cos^2 \phi = 1 \). Providing explicit steps leading from the definition of \( \phi \) to its sine and cosine forms will enhance clarity. A re-examination of the relationships between \( x \), \( \theta \), and \( \phi \) within the context of the problem would also strengthen the final expressions derived.
